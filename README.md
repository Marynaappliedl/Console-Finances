# Console-Finances

## Description

I created this project to analyze a provided dataset and based on it to calculate  total number of months included in the dataset, net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period,  greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
-I learnt how to manage arrays operations
-I`ve polished my cycles knowledge and worked with some simple operators
